# ðŸ”¬ PDE Solvers and RDSF-Based Parameter Estimation

This repository provides a collection of Python scripts for analyzing and solving well-known partial differential equations (PDEs) using multiple methods. The project focuses on:

- Developing and comparing numerical solvers: Finite Difference, Spectral Methods, and PINNs
- Designing trial solutions and residual functions
- Estimating optimal parameters using the RDSF algorithm (Residual-Driven Search for Function parameters)

## âœ… Included PDEs

- Allenâ€“Cahn Equation
- Burgers' Equation
- Fisherâ€“KPP Equation
- 1D Navierâ€“Stokes Equation

Each PDE is solved using multiple numerical approaches, and residual-based heatmaps are used to tune trial function parameters.
